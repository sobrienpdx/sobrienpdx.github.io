      <h2> First, a little background information...</h2>
      <img src="sloth1.jpg">
      <p class="info"> Sloths are highly successful, slow-moving mammals that spend their lives hanging about in the trees of Central and South America. There are two types of sloth. There are two basic kinds of sloths, two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths. There are six glorious species of sloth.<br /> <br />
      Sloths have distinctive features such as long claws, buggy eyes, long leggs and fur tinted green from the algae that grow in it. If there were fast-moving meat eaters they would be the stuff of nightmares. Luckily though sloths are super duper slow (hence the name!) and are folivores, meaning they eat mainly leafy things. Hibiscus flowers are one of their favorite treats.
